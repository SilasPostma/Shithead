This is a first version of a cardgame i play with friends. However this  verrsion doesnt allow you to play with friends yet :(. For now the code just contains the framework of the rules and the classes for the cards and the deck. 
In the future I will start with rewriting the code... because it has gotten verryy messy. And after i will be implementing a bot to play against.
